## 📋 Comprehensive Cursor Rules Integration

Based on the complete analysis of your `.cursor/rules/` directory, I've integrated all guidelines into our collaboration framework:

### 🔒 Security Standards (Critical Priority)

**From `.cursor/rules/security-standards.mdc`**:

#### API Key and Secret Management
- **NEVER** hardcode API keys, database credentials, or secrets in source code
- Use environment variables (.env files) for all sensitive configuration
- Rotate API keys regularly with least-privilege principles
- Separate environment files for development, staging, production

#### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with max 24-hour expiration
- bcrypt with salt rounds ≥ 12 for password hashing
- Strong passwords: minimum 8 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for tutors, students, admins
- Rate limiting on login endpoints (brute force prevention)
- Session timeout for idle users (30 minutes max)

#### Educational Data Compliance
- **FERPA** guidelines for student educational records
- **COPPA** compliance for users under 13
- **GDPR** compliance features (data export, deletion, consent)
- Audit logging for student data access
- Data retention policies implementation

**Rovo Dev Integration**: All security audits and compliance checks are handled through the `security_audit` tool with educational data-specific validation.

### 🎥 Video Conferencing Specific Rules

**Enhanced from multiple rule files**:

#### Frontend Video Handling
- **Graceful permission requests** for camera/microphone
- **Proper WebRTC error handling** with fallbacks
- **STUN/TURN servers** for NAT traversal
- **Bandwidth optimization** based on connection quality
- **Media stream cleanup** to prevent memory leaks

#### Backend Real-time Communication
