## Production Security Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

### Environment Security
- [ ] All secrets are in environment variables (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Environment files are not committed to version control
- [ ] Production secrets are different from development
- [ ] Database credentials use least-privilege principle
- [ ] API keys are rotated regularly

### Network Security
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced (no HTTP traffic)
- [ ] Database is not publicly accessible
- [ ] Firewall rules are properly configured
- [ ] VPN access for admin operations

### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Error tracking is configured (Sentry recommended)
- [ ] Audit logs for sensitive operations
- [ ] Failed login attempt monitoring
- [ ] Database access logging
- [ ] File upload monitoring

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Backup encryption
- [ ] Intrusion detection system
- [ ] DDoS protection
- [ ] Load balancer security configuration

## Security Best Practices for Development

### Code Security
- Always validate user input on both client and server
- Use parameterized queries (Prisma handles this)
- Never log sensitive information
- Implement proper error handling without exposing internals
- Keep dependencies updated

### Secret Management
```bash
# Never commit these files
.env
.env.local
.env.production
secrets/
```

### Database Security
- Use connection pooling
- Implement proper indexing
- Regular security patches
- Encrypted backups
- Access audit trails

## Incident Response Plan
