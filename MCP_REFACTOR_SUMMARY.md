### 3. `generate_tests`
**Purpose**: Intelligent test generation and coverage analysis
- Creates unit, integration, API, and E2E tests
- Analyzes existing code to generate appropriate test cases
- Includes coverage analysis and testing recommendations

### 4. `refactor_code`
**Purpose**: Code quality and maintainability improvements
- Supports multiple refactoring types (extract_function, extract_class, optimize, modernize)
- Provides targeted suggestions for specific code sections
- Helps with performance optimization and code modernization

### 5. `database_analysis`
**Purpose**: Database design and performance optimization

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Type Safety & Validation
- **Zod schemas** for all tool arguments with runtime validation
- **TypeScript interfaces** for compile-time type checking
- **Proper error types** using MCP SDK error codes

### Modern Development Practices
- **ES Modules** with proper import/export syntax
- **Async/await patterns** for better error handling
- **Modular architecture** for easy extension and maintenance

### Enhanced Error Handling
- **MCP-compliant error codes**: `ErrorCode.MethodNotFound`, `ErrorCode.InvalidParams`, etc.
- **Detailed error messages** with context and suggestions
- **Graceful degradation** for missing files or permissions

### Testing & Validation
- **Comprehensive test suite** with schema validation
- **Setup validation script** to ensure proper configuration
- **Debug mode** for detailed logging and troubleshooting

## 🚀 Configuration Updates

### Updated `.cursor/mcp.json`
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tuteasy-rovo-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./dist/mcp-server.js"],
      "env": {
        "WORKSPACE_ROOT": ".",
        "PROJECT_TYPE": "tuteasy-tutoring-platform",
        "MCP_DEBUG": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### New Package Scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "start": "node dist/mcp-server.js",
    "dev": "tsx src/mcp-server.ts",
    "test": "npm run build && vitest",
    "test:watch": "vitest --watch",
    "test:coverage": "vitest --coverage",
    "clean": "rm -rf dist",
    "prebuild": "npm run clean"
  }
}
```

## ✅ Validation Results
