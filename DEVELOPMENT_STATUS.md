# TutEasy Development Status

## ✅ Completed - Backend Build Error Resolution

### Dependency & Build Fixes
- [x] **Resolved Dependency Conflicts**: Fixed type conflicts between root and backend `package.json` files by adding `@sendgrid/mail` and `nodemailer` to backend dependencies, ensuring a stable build environment.
- [x] **Corrected `emailService.ts`**: Uncommented the file and resolved all syntax errors after the missing `@sendgrid/mail` dependency was added.
- [x] **Fixed `server.ts` Type Errors**: Bypassed `RateLimitRequestHandler` type conflicts by temporarily using `as any`, allowing the build to proceed.
- [x] **Addressed Unused Variables**: Removed unused `updatedUser` variable in `authService.ts` and `RequestHandler` import in `server.ts` to clean up the code.
- [x] **Resolved `storage.service.ts` Errors**: Correctly initialized the `S3Client`, handled optional credentials, and restored the local file deletion fallback.
- [x] **Fixed Prisma Mocking in Tests**: Corrected all `mockResolvedValue` errors in `parentProfile.service.test.ts` by casting Prisma methods to `jest.Mock`.
- [x] **Final Build Success**: The backend build is now successful with no errors.

### Current Status
- **Build Passing**: The backend build is stable and all services are compiling correctly.
- **Ready for Development**: The backend is now in a stable state for further development and feature implementation.
