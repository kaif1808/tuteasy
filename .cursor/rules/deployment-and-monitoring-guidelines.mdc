# Deployment and Monitoring Guidelines

## Environment Management
- Use separate environments: `development`, `staging`, and `production`.
- Implement proper Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines (e.g., using GitHub Actions).
- Use Docker for consistent deployment environments across all stages.
- Implement health checks for all services that can be used by load balancers or orchestration platforms.
- Set up proper logging with a structured log format (e.g., JSON) for easier parsing and analysis.

## Monitoring and Alerting
- Implement error tracking with tools like Sentry to capture and diagnose issues in production.
- Monitor application performance and user experience (e.g., using APM tools, frontend performance monitoring).
- Set up alerts for critical failures (e.g., payment processing errors, video call failures, high error rates, resource exhaustion).
- Track key business metrics (e.g., user registration rates, session completion rates, active users).
- Monitor infrastructure costs and resource usage to optimize spending and ensure scalability.

## Regular Maintenance (Performance & Deployment Related)

### Performance Reviews
- Monitor and optimize database query performance continuously.
- Review and update caching strategies based on usage patterns and performance data.
- Optimize application bundle sizes and loading times for frontend assets.
- Review and update API rate limits based on observed traffic and service capacity.
