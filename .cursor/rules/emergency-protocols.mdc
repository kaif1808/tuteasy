# Emergency Protocols for Tutoring CRM Platform

## Incident Response Procedures

### Immediate Response (0-15 minutes)
- **Assess Impact**: Determine severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
  - Critical: Platform down, data breach, payment system failure
  - High: Core features unavailable, video calls failing, authentication issues
  - Medium: Performance degradation, non-critical feature failures
  - Low: Minor UI issues, non-blocking bugs

### Severity Level Definitions

#### Critical Incidents
- Complete platform outage affecting all users
- Data breach or suspected unauthorized access to student/tutor information
- Payment processing failures preventing transactions
- Security vulnerabilities actively being exploited
- Database corruption or data loss

#### High Priority Incidents
- Authentication system failures preventing user login
- Video conferencing system completely down
- API failures affecting core tutoring functionality
- Performance issues causing widespread user complaints
- Third-party service outages affecting critical features

### Escalation Matrix
1. **Level 1**: On-call developer (0-15 minutes response time)
2. **Level 2**: Lead developer + DevOps engineer (15-30 minutes)
3. **Level 3**: Technical lead + Product manager (30-60 minutes)
4. **Level 4**: CTO + Legal team (for data breaches, 1-2 hours)

## Rollback Procedures

### Database Rollbacks
- **Prerequisites**: Verify database backup integrity before rollback
- **Steps**:
  1. Stop application servers to prevent new transactions
  2. Create emergency backup of current state
  3. Restore from verified backup point
  4. Verify data integrity post-rollback
  5. Restart services and monitor for issues

### Application Deployment Rollbacks
- **Automated Rollback**: Use CI/CD pipeline rollback feature
- **Manual Rollback**: 
  1. Tag current deployment as "rollback-candidate"
  2. Deploy previous stable version
  3. Update DNS/load balancer if necessary
  4. Verify functionality across all critical paths
  5. Notify stakeholders of rollback completion

### Feature Flag Rollbacks
- Immediately disable problematic feature flags
- Verify feature is properly disabled for all users
- Monitor logs for residual issues from disabled feature

## Communication Protocols

### Internal Communication
- **Immediate**: Slack emergency channel for all incidents
- **Documentation**: Create incident ticket in project management system
- **Status Updates**: Every 30 minutes during active incidents
- **Post-Incident**: Schedule post-mortem within 48 hours

### External Communication
- **Status Page**: Update platform status page within 15 minutes
- **User Notifications**: In-app notifications for ongoing issues
- **Email Updates**: For incidents lasting >2 hours
- **Social Media**: For widespread outages only

### Communication Templates

#### Internal Alert Template
```
INCIDENT ALERT - [SEVERITY]
Time: [UTC TIME]
Issue: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION]
Impact: [USER/SYSTEM IMPACT]
Response Team: [ASSIGNED PERSONNEL]
ETA for Update: [TIME]
```

#### User Communication Template
```
We're currently experiencing [ISSUE TYPE] affecting [AFFECTED SERVICES].
Our team is working to resolve this issue.
Expected resolution: [TIME ESTIMATE]
We'll provide updates every [FREQUENCY].
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Data Recovery
- **Student/Tutor Data**: Restore from encrypted backups with audit trail
- **Session Records**: Prioritize recent tutoring session data
- **Payment Data**: Coordinate with payment processor for transaction recovery
- **File Uploads**: Restore from cloud storage backups

### Service Recovery Checklist
1. Verify database connectivity and integrity
2. Confirm authentication services are functional
3. Test video conferencing capabilities
4. Validate payment processing
5. Check real-time messaging/notifications
6. Verify file upload/download functionality
7. Test mobile app functionality
8. Confirm email delivery systems

## Preventive Maintenance Schedules

### Daily Monitoring
- Database performance metrics review
- Error rate monitoring across all services
- Security scan results review
- Backup verification (automated with manual spot checks)

### Weekly Maintenance
- Dependency security audit and updates
- Performance optimization review
- Load testing of critical user paths
- Review and update monitoring alerts

### Monthly Maintenance
- Full security audit and penetration testing
- Database optimization and index analysis
- Disaster recovery drill execution
- Emergency contact information verification
- Review and update incident response procedures

### Quarterly Maintenance
- Complete infrastructure health assessment
- Business continuity plan review and testing
- Vendor relationship and SLA review
- Staff emergency response training
- Compliance audit (FERPA, COPPA, GDPR)

## Circuit Breaker Implementation

### External API Calls
- Implement timeouts (5 seconds for critical APIs, 10 seconds for non-critical)
- Use exponential backoff for retry attempts
- Fail gracefully with appropriate user messaging
- Log all circuit breaker activations for monitoring

### Database Connections
- Implement connection pooling with maximum connection limits
- Use read replicas for non-critical read operations during high load
- Implement query timeouts to prevent long-running query impacts

## Emergency Development Procedures

### Hotfix Deployment Process
1. Create emergency branch from production
2. Implement minimal fix with comprehensive testing
3. Fast-track code review with two senior developers
4. Deploy to staging for smoke testing
5. Deploy to production with all monitoring active
6. Document emergency change for post-incident review

### Security Incident Response
1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Contain**: Prevent further unauthorized access
3. **Investigate**: Determine scope and impact
4. **Eradicate**: Remove security threats
5. **Recover**: Restore secure operations
6. **Learn**: Conduct thorough post-incident analysis

## Post-Incident Procedures

### Post-Mortem Requirements
- **Timeline**: Complete within 48 hours of incident resolution
- **Participants**: All responding team members + stakeholders
- **Documentation**: Root cause analysis, timeline, impact assessment
- **Action Items**: Concrete steps to prevent recurrence
- **Follow-up**: Review action item completion within 30 days

### Learning Integration
- Update emergency procedures based on lessons learned
- Share relevant learnings with entire development team
- Update monitoring and alerting based on incident patterns
- Consider infrastructure improvements to prevent similar issues
