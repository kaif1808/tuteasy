# Cursor + Rovo Dev Collaboration Example

## Real-time Collaboration Demonstration: Storage Service Implementation

This document demonstrates how Cursor's agent and Rovo Dev can collaborate effectively on complex development tasks.

### Task: Implement Complete Storage Service with Security

**Complexity Level**: High (Multi-service integration, security considerations, testing)

### Collaboration Workflow

#### Phase 1: Analysis & Architecture (Rovo Dev)
- ✅ **Analyzed existing codebase** to understand storage requirements
- ✅ **Identified integration points** with existing services
- ✅ **Reviewed security requirements** from Cursor rules
- ✅ **Planned multi-service implementation** (Cloudinary + S3)

#### Phase 2: Complex Implementation (Rovo Dev)
- ✅ **Implemented comprehensive storage interfaces** with TypeScript
- ✅ **Added image processing** with Sharp integration
- ✅ **Implemented security validations** and file type detection
- ✅ **Created error handling** with custom AppError integration
- ✅ **Added signed URL generation** for secure document access

#### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Rovo Dev)
- ✅ **Created comprehensive test suite** with Jest
- ✅ **Mocked external dependencies** (AWS S3, Cloudinary)
- ✅ **Added security test cases** for malicious file detection
- ✅ **Implemented edge case testing** for error scenarios

#### Phase 4: Security Enhancement (Rovo Dev)
- ✅ **Created file validation service** with MIME type detection
- ✅ **Added malicious content scanning** for images and PDFs
- ✅ **Implemented filename sanitization** to prevent path traversal
- ✅ **Added file signature verification** using magic numbers

### What Cursor Agent Could Handle Next

Based on this implementation, Cursor's agent could efficiently handle:

1. **UI Integration**:
   ```typescript
   // Cursor could create React components for file upload
   const FileUploadComponent = () => {
     const { uploadFile } = useStorageService();
     // ... implementation
   };
   ```

2. **API Route Integration**:
   ```typescript
   // Cursor could update existing controllers to use new storage service
   app.post('/api/upload', async (req, res) => {
     const result = await storageService.uploadImage(buffer, filename);
     // ... response handling
   });
   ```

3. **Form Validation**:
   ```typescript
   // Cursor could add client-side validation
   const validateFileUpload = (file: File) => {
     // Basic validation logic
   };
   ```

### Handoff Points

#### From Rovo Dev to Cursor:
- **Complex backend services** → **UI components**
- **Security implementations** → **User experience**
- **API design** → **Frontend integration**

#### From Cursor to Rovo Dev:
- **UI bugs** → **Complex debugging**
- **Simple features** → **Architecture changes**
- **Styling issues** → **Security reviews**

### Collaboration Triggers

#### Automatic Handoffs:
1. **File changes in `/services/`** → Trigger Rovo Dev for architecture review
2. **Changes in auth middleware** → Trigger Rovo Dev for security audit
3. **Test failures in security tests** → Trigger Rovo Dev for investigation
4. **Simple component updates** → Handle with Cursor agent

#### Manual Handoffs:
1. **"Need security review"** → Rovo Dev
2. **"Need UI component"** → Cursor agent
3. **"Complex refactoring needed"** → Rovo Dev
4. **"Style updates needed"** → Cursor agent

### Integration Benefits Demonstrated

1. **Complementary Strengths**:
   - Rovo Dev: Complex logic, security, architecture
   - Cursor: UI/UX, simple integrations, styling

2. **Efficiency Gains**:
   - Rovo Dev handles time-consuming complex implementations
   - Cursor handles rapid UI iterations and simple features

3. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Rovo Dev provides comprehensive testing and security
   - Cursor ensures good user experience and code style

4. **Knowledge Sharing**:
   - Both agents learn from each other's implementations
   - Consistent patterns across the codebase

### Next Steps for Full Integration

1. **Set up MCP server** using the provided configuration
2. **Configure workflow automation** with the shell scripts
3. **Implement real-time triggers** in Cursor settings
4. **Test collaboration workflows** with actual development tasks

### Metrics for Success

- **Reduced development time** for complex features
- **Improved code quality** through specialized expertise
- **Better security coverage** through automated reviews
- **Enhanced developer experience** through intelligent task routing

This example demonstrates that Cursor + Rovo Dev collaboration can significantly enhance development productivity while maintaining high code quality and security standards.
