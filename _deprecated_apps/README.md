# Deprecated Code

**This `apps/` directory is deprecated and no longer actively maintained.**

The code within this directory (`apps/backend/` and `apps/frontend/`) represents earlier or experimental versions of the TutEasy platform.

Active development has been consolidated into the root-level `backend/` and `frontend/` directories. Please refer to those for the current codebase.

**Developers should not make changes here or rely on this code for new features.**

If you believe any specific code from this directory is still valuable and not present in the root-level directories, please discuss with the team about migrating it properly before considering its use.
